				Here's the deal. You need to drop an egg from the third floor, and it has to survive. You might think that's easy, just wrap it in a bunch of bubblewrap. But that's not how it goes this time. We had to design something that meats these criteria:
				<ul id="frontlist">
				<ul>
					<li>Use an M size egg.</li>
					<li>You can't use any filler material like wool, cotton, sponge, balloons, or hairgel.</li>
					<li>The starting size is a maximum of 12x12x12cm.</li>
					<li>The egg needs to be inspected within 20 seconds after falling.</li>
					<li>The egg needs to stay intact without cracks.</li>
					<li>The same egg needs to be used for each drop.</li>
					<li>The fall needs to be a free fall, so no bungee cord or other attatchments.</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>

			<center><h1>Design Proposal</h1></center>
			<p>
				Our design will be a triangular pyramid structure much like other teamsâ€™ design, but instead of using straws we decided to use wooden skewers. We came up with the brilliant idea of using string with wood glue to hold the skewers together, which turned out to be really strong.
				<br><br>
				<b>Materials</b>
				<ul>
					<li>6 wooden skewers</li>
					<li>6 rubber bands</li>
					<li>Cotton or hemp string (plastic will not absorb glue)</li>
					<li>Scotch tape</li>
					<li>Plastic garbage bag</li>
					<li>Wood glue</li>
					<li>Scissors</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Procedure</b>

			<p style="width: 44vw; float: left; padding-right: 1vw;">
				The shuttle design made from wooden skewers worked really well but the parachute didn't work that great. It does create more than enough drag but we had to add straws to make it stay open and it needed to be thrown unfolded in orded to perform well, thus not meeting the size constraint. It was also prone to collapsing. We decided that we needed a better parachute to meet the criteria.

			<center><h1>Improving Design</h1></center>
			<p style="width: 44vw; float: left; padding-right: 1vw;">
				We did some research online on how to fold a parachute and we found along the way that a round parachute with eight strings performs much better than four strings. We also found that putting a hole in the middle of a parachute is done to improve stability and decrease the chance of collapsing.
				<br><br>
				So that's what we did. We cut out a circle, cut a hole in the middle and cut a section from one side to create a shallow cone shape. We then attached eight strings with tape and glued them together to one string.

			<center><h1>Final Test</h1></center>
			<p style="width: 44vw; float: left; padding-right: 1vw;">
				The final design passed the three story drop without a problem. The parachute opened quickly and it glided down smoothly without any oscillations or other problems. I'm really satisfied with the result

			<center><h1>How not to do it...</h1></center>
			<p style="width: 44vw; float: left; padding-right: 1vw;">
				This is a perfect example of what not to do. This was a different team that failed miserably. The parachute is flat and only has four strings. They attached the strings to pruding straws which only amplified any tilt in the capsule. Even a simple plastic bag would have performed better than the this parachute.
